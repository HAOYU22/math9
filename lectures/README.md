# Viewing the lectures without installing Python and Jupyter

Github mangles the math when it renders Jupyter notebooks.
To see the math rendered correctly, go to
[nbviewer](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/).
There you'll see a search field. Paste
the URL of the github notebook into the search field.
nbviewer will render the notebook, math and all.

For your convenience, I'll provide links to the nbviewer-version of each 
lecture in the [course schedule](../README.md#schedule).
